## &#10162; Visibility:
Bootstrap gives the ability to control visibility of the element. But it sets visibility property in CSS and not display property.	

*Syntax:*
- `.visible` class will make content to be visible.
- `.invisible` class will make content to be invisible but takes space in the container.

```html
<div class="invisible">...</div>
```
